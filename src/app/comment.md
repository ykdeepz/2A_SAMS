Comments / Questions

- What is the purpose of the HTML and Login file inside the app components?

- Who taught you to create the shared file? That is not how I taught the sidebar. The structure you made is different from what I demonstrated.

- The mock data you created is inside the services folder. I taught you to place it in the JSON server instead.

W- hat is the purpose of the HomeComponent inside app components? And why is there another home inside the pages folder?

- Please fix the design of the Login and Sign Up cards. The height is too long. Use the left and right space properly so the page will no longer be scrollable.

- Add SweetAlert for login and logout notifications.
